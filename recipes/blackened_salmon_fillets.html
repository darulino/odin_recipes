        <h2>Blackened Salmon Fillet is a game-changer.</h2>
        
        <p>The technique involves seasoning the fish, in this case salmon, well and cooking it in a very hot pan with a decent amount of butter. The results are intensely flavoured salmon with a crust like exterior that's dark, but not burnt, and tender flaky salmon that isn't dried out from being over cooked. The salmon will have a small kick to it, but isn't overpowering and a fresh squeeze of lime juice mellows out the heat for a perfect bite.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>4 salmon fillets, skin and bones removed</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix paprika, cayenne pepper, onion powder, salt, white and black pepper, thyme, basil, and oregano together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Brush salmon fillets on both sides with 1/4 cup butter, and sprinkle evenly with the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons melted butter in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add salmon and cook until blackened, 2 to 5 minutes. Lift fillets, add remaining melted butter to the skillet, and flip fillets into the butter. Cook until the other side is blackened and fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
